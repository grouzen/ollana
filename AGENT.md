# Ollana Agent Specification

## Overview

Ollana is an intelligent agent designed to facilitate seamless access to Ollama servers across local networks. It automatically discovers available Ollama instances and provides transparent proxying capabilities, allowing clients to interact with remote Ollama servers without complex configuration.

## Agent Capabilities

### Core Functionality
- **Auto-discovery**: Automatically detects Ollama servers on the local network using UDP broadcast discovery
- **Transparent Proxying**: Acts as an HTTP proxy that forwards requests between clients and Ollama servers
- **Multi-server Management**: Manages connections to multiple Ollama servers with automatic failover
- **Liveness Monitoring**: Continuously monitors server availability and removes unreachable servers from rotation

### Technical Capabilities
- **Cross-platform Support**: Runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows systems
- **Zero Configuration**: Requires no manual setup of client applications
- **Dynamic Discovery**: Adapts to network changes automatically
- **High Availability**: Maintains connection to the most responsive server available
- **Secure Communication**: Uses standard HTTP/HTTPS protocols for communication

### Agent Modes
1. **Server Mode**: 
   - Runs an HTTP proxy that forwards requests to a local Ollama instance
   - Broadcasts its presence on the network for client discovery
   - Handles incoming requests from clients and forwards them to the local Ollama server

2. **Client Mode**:
   - Discovers available Ollama servers on the network
   - Manages connections to multiple servers
   - Provides transparent proxying to the currently active server
   - Performs liveness checks to ensure server availability

## Interaction Protocols

### Discovery Protocol
- **UDP Broadcast**: Uses UDP broadcast messages with magic number `0x4C414E41` (LANA) for discovery
- **Port**: Default discovery port `11436`
- **Frequency**: Broadcasts every 5 seconds in client mode
- **Response**: Servers respond to discovery messages with their own presence

### HTTP Proxy Protocol
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Supports standard HTTP protocols for proxying requests
- **Request Forwarding**: Forwards all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) transparently
- **Streaming Support**: Handles streaming responses for long-running operations
- **Path Preservation**: Maintains original request paths and query parameters

### Communication Patterns
1. **Client-Server Discovery**:
   - Client broadcasts discovery message
   - Server responds with its own presence
   - Client registers server in its connection pool

2. **Proxy Request Flow**:
   - Client sends HTTP request to Ollana proxy
   - Proxy forwards request to active Ollama server
   - Response is forwarded back to client

## Data Handling Procedures

### Data Flow Architecture
```
Client Application → [Ollana Client Proxy] → [Ollama Server]
                    ↑
            [Network Discovery]
                    ↓
            [Ollana Server Proxy] ← [Ollama Instance]
```

### Data Processing
- **Request Forwarding**: All HTTP requests are forwarded without modification
- **Response Handling**: All responses are forwarded transparently to clients
- **Stream Management**: Supports streaming data for long-running operations
- **Error Propagation**: Errors from Ollama servers are propagated back to clients

### Security Considerations
- **Local Network Only**: Designed for local network use only
- **No Data Encryption**: Uses standard HTTP (not HTTPS) by default
- **Authentication**: No built-in authentication mechanisms
- **Access Control**: Relies on network-level access controls

## Safety Measures

### System Safety
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup of resources during shutdown
- **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup of unused connections and proxies
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling to prevent crashes
- **Memory Management**: Efficient memory usage with proper resource cleanup

### Network Safety
- **Broadcast Limitations**: Uses standard broadcast addresses only
- **Port Isolation**: Uses dedicated ports for different functions (discovery, proxy)
- **Timeout Handling**: Configurable timeouts for network operations
- **Connection Limits**: Prevents excessive connection attempts

### Operational Safety
- **Daemon Mode Support**: Can run as a background service
- **Process Management**: Proper process isolation and management
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Health Checks**: Automatic liveness checking of servers

## Performance Metrics

### System Performance
- **Response Time**: Typically under 10ms for local network requests
- **Throughput**: Supports concurrent connections up to system limits
- **Resource Usage**: Minimal CPU and memory footprint during operation
- **Latency**: Network latency dependent on local network conditions

### Monitoring Metrics
- **Connection Count**: Number of active server connections
- **Request Rate**: Requests per second processed
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed requests
- **Proxy Latency**: Time taken to forward requests

### Performance Optimization
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuses connections where possible
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Uses async/await for non-blocking operations
- **Efficient Streaming**: Handles large payloads efficiently
- **Load Balancing**: Automatically selects the best available server

## Integration Guidelines

### Client Integration
1. **Configuration-Free Setup**:
   - No client-side configuration required
   - Automatically discovers and connects to servers

2. **API Compatibility**:
   - Fully compatible with standard Ollama API endpoints
   - Supports all Ollama HTTP methods and parameters

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - `RUST_LOG` for logging control
   - Standard environment variables for network configuration

### Server Integration
1. **Deployment**:
   - Run `ollana serve` to start in server mode
   - Use `ollana serve -d` for daemon mode

2. **Network Configuration**:
   - Ensure UDP broadcast is enabled on the network
   - Verify firewall allows traffic on configured ports

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Monitor logs for system status and errors
   - Use standard process monitoring tools

### Development Integration
1. **Build Requirements**:
